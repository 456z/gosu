Really open ends:
  23:31:12 Andares: You need to add -lXmu and -lXi to the makefile
- document Gosu's Sockets
- rethink and document Gosu's IO philosophy
- convenience functions for loading images, samples and songs from files?

Major design goals for 0.6x (timing):
- redesign Gosu::Window to be more useful for framerate independent games?
- anyway, get rid of WM_TIMER

Major design goals for 0.7x (gfx):
- find a way to factor RotFlips out of Gosu => Image redesign
- implement clipping and a target() modifier for the new Image
- actually, "Blit" is wrongly named in Gosu. Do we care?

Major design goals for 0.8x (input):
- implement gamepad/joystick input under Unix
- input: using polled devices must suck when the update interval is higher than, say, 20 - fix/doc/whatever that
- redesign Input's interface (multi-gamepad support, analog joystick support, POV support etc. etc.)
- Windows: Input will regularly query not attached devices, thereby causing the game to halt every few seconds - think about this
- automatically register KbA etc. constants under Ruby
- decouple id<>char conversion from Gosu::Input/Gosu::Window

Later:
- Port Win::appFilename/appDirectory to Unix or get rid of filename related stuff altogether (actually boost::filesystem is nice, except it doesn't use wstrings)
- Bitmap enlargement during hardBorders application process should use the same algorithm as setColorKey does to prevent minimal borders
- D3D fullscreen window shouldn't popup on creation
- Gosu/Gosu.hpp which includes everything?
- implement PNG color keying
- add examples for Gosu::Song, Gosu::Text, Gosu::Net?
- more documentation for MS Unicows
- RubyGosu: fix valueToColor(0xfffffffffffff)
- clear Window with black on show
- align text on pixel borders to improve readability
- Windows: allow loading of local .ttf files.
- Windows: font AA
- song end callback
- image using tiles to show the difference between hardborders true/false
- test whether createText should return by value or if this is unoptimized
- more UNICODE integration
- implement Z=0 optimization on D3D
- OpenGL integration under Windows
- switch to OpenAL to get rid of FMOD's license
- Auto-FSAA
- all other TODO/FIXME/HACK/UPGR/PORT comments
- all other IMPR comments
