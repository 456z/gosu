TODO 0.7 (Google release):
- redesign input
- convenience functions for loading images, samples and songs from files?
- move docs to Google
- setup forwarding from raschke.de
- explain in general why we won't do XYZ and why you have to use boost.
- switch to MSVC 05
- polish Ruby wrappers
- delegate Linux support (help!)

Major design goals for 0.7x (immediately needed for projects):
- USB input on Mac!!!!!
- TextInput system (clean implementation on Mac, workaround on other platforms)
- more sophisticated Audio interface for talking NPC's etc.

Major design goals for 0.8x (gfx):
- use OpenGL on Windows
- allow custom OpenGL integration
- find a way to factor RotFlips out of Gosu => Image redesign
- implement clipping and a target() modifier for the new Image
- multi-threaded BlitQueue and float-z-ordering?

Major design goals for 0.9x (IO, timing):
- rework and document Gosu's IO philosophy
- redesign Gosu::Window to be more useful for framerate independent games?
- anyway, get rid of WM_TIMER
- document or kill Gosu's Sockets

Major design goals for 1.0x (perfection):
- Windows: Input will regularly query devices which are not currently attached, thereby causing the game to halt every few seconds - think about this
- automatically register KbA etc. constants under Ruby
- decouple id<>char conversion from Gosu::Input/Gosu::Window
- implement gamepad/joystick input under Unix
- more UNICODE integration (switch to UTF8?)
- <Your feedback here!>
