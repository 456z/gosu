<h1>Using Ruby/Gosu</h1>

<h2>Using Ruby/Gosu under Windows</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
  For Windows, there is a pre-compiled gosu.so that should be put somewhere where Ruby's require() will find it; for example, in "(RubyBaseDir)/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/i386-msvcrt/", or just ship it with your game. That's it!
</p>
<h3>Necessary DLLs</h3>
<p>
  Except the Visual C++ 7.1 runtime DLLs (msvcp71.dll and msvcr71.dll), Ruby/Gosu (or, games written in it) may need one or both of the following DLLs in order to run.
</p>
<p>
  If you are loading any samples or songs in your game, you need FMOD.DLL. You can get the latest release <a href="http://www.fmod.org/ifmoddownload.html">here</a> (you need version 3.0!).
</p>
<p>
  If you want to run your Ruby scripts on Windows 9x, the Microsoft Layer for Unicode (UNICOWS.DLL) must be present in the script's directory. On Windows NT (2000/XP), this DLL is not necessary. You can get the latest redistributable <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/default.htm?p=/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdkredist.htm">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Using Ruby/Gosu under Mac OS X</h2>
<p>
  In order for your game to run on OS X, you need a duplicate of Game.app, which comes with the Mac OS distribution of Gosu. This is a wrapper application that will run the contained Ruby/Gosu game. (Customizing this application will be possible at a later point).
</p>
<p>
  Just copy the files of your game into Game.app/Contents/Resources. When launched, Game.app will run Main.rb in that directory. Game.app requires Gosu.framework to be installed (usually in /Library/Frameworks), as well as the libpng dynamic library (which is, at the moment, not included in Gosu.framework) which has to be moved into /usr/lib/.
</p>

<h2>Using Ruby/Gosu under Linux</h2>
<p>
  Under Linux, Ruby/Gosu has to be compiled manually. Read <a href="using-gcc.html">Using Gosu with gcc under Linux</a> first.
</p>
<p>
  Ruby itself has to be compiled with pthread-support in order to work with Gosu, which uses fmod, which uses pthreads. (This is the default for many distributions). Gentoo users, for example, may add "threads" to their USE-Variable before emerging ruby.
