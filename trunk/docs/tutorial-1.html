<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This tutorial will guide you through the design of a small (and pointless) game that uses many of Gosu's features. The code for the tutorial game can be found in the examples directory. If you have correctly set up everything, you should be able to compile and run it. We recommend playing around with the source and eventually extending the game a bit to get a feel for using the Gosu library.

<h2>Recommended Knowledge (C++ only)</h2>
<p>
  To really understand what is going on in the tutorial game's code, you should know the basics of STL containers (vector and list is all we're going to use), boost::scoped_ptr and boost::shared_ptr.
