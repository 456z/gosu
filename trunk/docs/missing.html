<h1>Things that have not yet been implemented in Gosu</h1>
<p>There are some things we just have not found the time to figure out how to accomplish them yet. Many of them will go away soon, as we are actually using Gosu to develop our own projects. <b>However, reading docs of (mostly unknown) libraries takes time; if you roughly know how to accomplish some task or another why not <a href="mailto:julian@raschke.de">just mail us some hints to speed up development?</a> Thanks! :)</p>
<p><ul>
  <li>Drawing additively using the OpenGL API (affects Mac and Linux versions)</li>
  <li>Getting gamepad/joystick input on the Mac and Linux versions</li>
  <li>Full-screen mode on the Mac</li>
  <li>Customizing the wrapper .app for Ruby on the Mac</li>
  <li>A nice window menu for Mac games</li>
</ul></p>
