<h1>Using Gosu with Apple Xcode</h1>

<h2>Installing the Gosu framework</h2>
<p>
  Copy the supplied mac/Gosu.framework file to /Library/Frameworks/Gosu.
  This is the only step that is also necessary for users of your game.
</p>

<h2>Installing Other Libraries</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a></h3>
<p>
  This is a collection of libraries that is used throughout Gosu. Many parts of Boost have been marked for inclusion in the next standard of C++, so you should take a look at it anyway!
</p>
<p>
  Download and extract the latest boost release. Open a terminal, go to that directory and run:
  <pre>
    /.configure
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/include/boost-1_33_1/boost /usr/local/include/boost
  </pre>
  (Replace "1_33_1" with boost's current version.)
</p>

<!--<h3><a href="http://www.fmod.org/">FMOD</a></h3>
<p>
  This is the library used by Gosu for all sound output.
</p>
<p>
  After downloading and extracting the ZIP archive, open a terminal again and run, from the fmodapi directory:
  <pre>
    sudo mv api/inc/* /usr/local/include
    sudo mv api/lib/libfmod.a /usr/local/lib
  </pre>
</p>-->

<h2>Creating a Gosu project</h2>
<p>
  In Xcode, create a new Cocoa application project. Remove Resources/MainMenu.nib, add a reference to the installed Gosu.framework and replace the main.m file by your game's code files - one of the tutorial files, for a start. (But don't forget to copy the tutorials' media folder into your project's build directory).
