#summary How to set up Gosu on Linux.

= Dependencies =

To compile Gosu, you will need the following packages (install via sudo apt-get install <packagename>):
  * g++
  * autoconf
  * libgl1-mesa-dev
  * libglu1-mesa-dev
  * libglut3-dev
  * libpango1.0-dev (Pango with freetype)
  * libboost-dev
  * libxxf86vm-dev

If you want to use FMOD for audio, fmod 3.75 must be unpacked into the folder "fmod" in the Gosu directory, or installed system-wide. Otherwise, SDL_mixer needs to be present (package libsdl-mixer1.2-dev).

Ruby/Gosu will be built if the following packages are installed as well:
  * ruby
  * ruby1.8 
  * ruby1.8-dev
  * swig1.3

= Compiling Gosu =

To compile Gosu for Unix, go into the "gcc" directory, and execute:

{{{
autoconf
./configure
make
}}}

= Compiling Gosu applications =

Copy or link Gosu into your application's directory. You've got to compile with `gosu/gcc/gosu-config --libs`, and -Igosu `gosu/gcc/gosu-config --cxxflags`

= Compiling your games =

A simple Makefile could look like this:

{{{
OBJS = main.o player.o
CXXFLAGS += -Igosu/ `gosu/gcc/gosu-config --cxxflags`
LIBS = `gosu/gcc/gosu-config --libs`

myGame: $(OBJS) gosu/gcc/gosu.a
        g++ -o myGame $(OBJS) gosu/gcc/gosu.a $(LIBS)
}}}
