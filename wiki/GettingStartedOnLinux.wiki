#summary How to set up Gosu on Linux.

= Dependencies =

To compile Gosu, you will need the following packages (install via sudo apt-get install <packagename>):
  * g++
  * autoconf
  * libgl1-mesa-dev
  * libglu1-mesa-dev
  * libglut3-dev
  * libpango1.0-dev
  * libboost-dev
  * libxxf86vm-dev  

If you want to use FMOD for audio, fmod 3.75 must be installed system-wide or manually unpacked so that the fmodâ€¦ folder is in the same folder as the Gosu, GosuImpl and linux folders. Otherwise, SDL_mixer needs to be present (package libsdl-mixer1.2-dev).


*Copy-and-pastable command line* for Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon), with SDL-mixer as the audio library *and without* Ruby support:

{{{
sudo apt-get install g++ autoconf libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libglut3-dev libpango1.0-dev libboost-dev libxxf86vm-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
}}}

Ruby/Gosu will be built if the following packages are installed as well:
  * ruby
  * ruby1.8 
  * ruby1.8-dev
  * swig (or swig1.3)

*Copy-and-pastable command line* for Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon), with SDL-mixer as the audio library *and* Ruby support:

{{{
sudo apt-get install g++ autoconf libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libglut3-dev libpango1.0-dev libboost-dev libxxf86vm-dev ruby ruby1.8 ruby1.8-dev swig libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
}}}

(Note: You have to enable the `universe` source under System->Administration->Software Sources.)

= Compiling Gosu =

To compile Gosu for Unix, go into the `linux` directory and execute:

{{{
autoconf
./configure
make
}}}

= Using Ruby/Gosu =
Just require gosu.so (`require 'gosu'`) and everything should work fine. You can copy gosu.so into the examples folder and run Tutorial.rb to check everything's okay.

= Using C++ Gosu =

Copy or link Gosu into your application's directory. You've got to compile with ``gosu/linux/gosu-config --libs``` and -Igosu ```gosu/linux/gosu-config --cxxflags``

A simple Makefile could look like this:

{{{
OBJS = main.o player.o
CXXFLAGS += -Igosu/ `gosu/linux/gosu-config --cxxflags`
LIBS = `gosu/linux/gosu-config --libs`

myGame: $(OBJS) gosu/linux/gosu.a
        g++ -o myGame $(OBJS) gosu/linux/gosu.a $(LIBS)
}}}
