#summary How to set up Gosu on Linux.

= Dependencies =

In order to get audio support, fmod (>=3.72) must be unpacked into the folder "fmod" in the gosu directory, or installed system-wide.
You can download the latest fmod 3.x at http://www.fmod.org
In addition you will need the following Packages:
  * xlibmesa-glu-dev
  * libpango1.0-dev (Pango with freetype)
  * X11, xf86 extensions (-lXxf86vm)
  * libPNG3 (or higher)
  * Boost (http://www.boost.org)
  * OpenGL

Most of these Packages can be found on your distributor's mirror-sites, the apt-tree or at the given position.

If you want to use Ruby-gosu and create a gosu.so you will have to install at least one of the following packages:
  * ruby (http://www.ruby-lang.org)
  * ruby-dev

= Compiling Gosu =

To compile Gosu for Unix, go into the "gcc" directory, and execute:

./configure
make
Execute "autoconf" if the configure-script doesn't work.
Compiling Gosu applications

Copy or link Gosu into your application's directory. You've got to compile with `gosu/gcc/gosu-config --libs`, and -Igosu `gosu/gcc/gosu-config --cxxflags`

= Compiling your games =

A simple Makefile could look like this:

OBJS = main.o player.o
CXXFLAGS += -Igosu/ `gosu/gcc/gosu-config --cxxflags`
LIBS = `gosu/gcc/gosu-config --libs`

myGame: $(OBJS) gosu/gcc/gosu.a
        g++ -o myGame $(OBJS) gosu/gcc/gosu.a $(LIBS)
