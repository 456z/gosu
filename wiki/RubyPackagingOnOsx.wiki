#summary How to wrap up Ruby/Gosu games for deployment on Mac OS X.

= Ruby/Gosu Packaging on Mac OS X =

The Mac package of Gosu comes with a mysterious `RubyGosu Tempate.app` bundle. All you have to do to share your game with the public is following these easy steps:
  * Duplicate this bundle, open its contents via the right-click menu
  * Copy your game files and gosu.bundle into the `Contents/Resources` subfolder
  * Rename your game's main source file to `Main.rb`
And you're done! You now have a fully functional .app bundle.

If you want to ship RMagick with your game, see [http://www.libgosu.org/cgi-bin/mwf/topic_show.pl?tid=42 this useful forum thread by codekitchen].
