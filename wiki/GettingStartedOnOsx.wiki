#summary How to set up Gosu on Mac OS X.

= Installing Boost (C++ only) =

[http://www.boost.org/ Boost] is a collection of libraries that is used throughout Gosu. Many parts of Boost have been marked for inclusion in the next standard of C++, so it's really worth a look!

Download and extract the latest Boost release. Open Terminal, 'cd' into to that directory and run:

{{{
    /.configure
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/include/boost-1_34/boost /usr/include/boost
}}}
  
(Replace "1_34" with boost's current version.)

= Starting a new Gosu game (C++) =

In Xcode, create a new 'Application/Cocoa Application' project. Remove Resources/MainMenu.nib and main.m (files & references), right-click the project and add a reference to Gosu.framework (wherever you have unpacked it to).

Your application also needs to include the Gosu.framework bundle. To instruct Xcode to automatically copy it into your application, choose Project/New Build Phase and select "Frameworks" as the Copy Files' target directory. Then locate this new build phase in the targets list and add Gosu.framework to it as well. (Note: You may have to drag & drop the framework into the build phase from the finder, instead of adding it via a right-click.)

You can then add new code files, for example the ones from the tutorial.

Note: Usually, you want to right-click your target, Get Info, select Build/All Configurations/Build Locations and *change the Per-configuration Build Products Path to '.'* or something similar, so the application will have the correct position relative to your game's resources.

= Starting a new Gosu game (Ruby) =

Getting started with Ruby is a lot easier (surprise): All you need to do is write down your code and run it in a way that `require 'gosu'` will work, i.e. by copying gosu.bundle into the same directory or installing it in one of Ruby's default library paths.
