#summary How to set up Gosu on Mac OS X.

= Installing Boost (C++ only) =

[http://www.boost.org/ Boost] is a collection of libraries that is used throughout Gosu. Many parts of Boost have been marked for inclusion in the next standard of C++, so it's really worth a look!

Download and extract the latest Boost release. Open Terminal, 'cd' into to that directory and run:

{{{
    /.configure
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/include/boost-1_34/boost /usr/include/boost
}}}
  
(Replace "1_34" with boost's current version.)

= Starting a new Gosu game (C++) =

In Xcode, create a new Cocoa application project. Remove Resources/MainMenu.nib and main.m (files & references), right-click the project and add a reference to Gosu.framework (wherever you have unpacked it to).

Your application also needs to include the Gosu.framework bundle. To instruct Xcode to automatically copy it into your application, choose Project->New Build Phase and select "Frameworks" as the Copy Files' target directory. Then locate this new build phase in the targets list and add Gosu.framework to it as well.

You can then add new code files, for example the ones from the tutorial.

= Starting a new Gosu game (Ruby) =

Getting started with Ruby is a lot easier: All you need to do is to duplicate the supplied template application and change its source code. To do this, just right-click it, choose "Show package contents" and navigate into the Resources directory. This is where your source code and media files go, for example the ones from the tutorial.
