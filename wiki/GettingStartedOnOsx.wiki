#summary How to set up Gosu on Mac OS X.

= Gosu.framework =

The supplied mac/Gosu.framework is the heart of Gosu, regardless of the language used. You can either install it into /Library/Frameworks, ~/Library/Frameworks or into the Frameworks directory of your application bundle's Contents folder.
Just copying it into /Library/Frameworks is probably the most convenient option to start right away.

= Installing Boost (C++ only) =

[http://www.boost.org/ Boost] is a collection of libraries that is used throughout Gosu. Many parts of Boost have been marked for inclusion in the next standard of C++, so it's really worth a look!

Download and extract the latest Boost release. Open a terminal, go to that directory and run:

{{{
    /.configure
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/include/boost-1_33_1/boost /usr/include/boost
}}}
  
(Replace "1_33_1" with boost's current version.)

= Starting a new Gosu game (C++) =

In Xcode, create a new Cocoa application project. Remove Resources/MainMenu.nib and main.m, then add a reference to the installed Gosu.framework.

You can then add new code files, for example the ones from the tutorial. (But don't forget to copy the media folder as well!)
