#summary Gosu's ToDo list.
#labels Featured

= TODO 0.7 (initial Mac only, Google release) =
  * move docs to Google
  * explain in general why we won't do XYZ and why you have to use boost.
  * setup forwarding from raschke.de
  * redesign input
  * convenience functions for loading images, samples and songs from files? (Maybe C++ coders just need to have it easier to start using Gosu.)

= Major design goals for 0.7x (immediately needed to complete playable games) =
  * USB input devices on Mac!
  * switch to MSVC 05
  * delegate Linux support (help!)
  * text input system for chat boxes, high-score lists etc.
  * more sophisticated Audio interface for talking NPC's etc.

= Major design goals for 0.8x (graphics) =
  * use OpenGL on Windows
  * allow custom OpenGL integration
  * find a way to factor rot flips out of Gosu => Image redesign
  * implement clipping and a target() modifier for the new Image
  * multi-threaded blit queue and float-z-ordering?

= Major design goals for 0.9x (IO, timing) =
  * rework and document Gosu's IO philosophy
  * redesign Gosu::Window to be more useful for framerate independent games?
  * anyway, get rid of WM_TIMER
  * document or kill Gosu's Sockets

= Major design goals for 1.x (perfection) =
  * Windows: Input will regularly query devices which are not currently attached, thereby causing the game to halt every few seconds - think about this
  * more UNICODE integration (switch to UTF8?)
