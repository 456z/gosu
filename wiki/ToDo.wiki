  * Redesign (see forum) drawing interface

  * Windows: Input will regularly query devices which are not currently attached, thereby causing the game to halt every few seconds - think about this
  * FSAA/mipmap experiments
  * force feedback would be cool
  * Provide C++ application templates where possible, maybe even installers for the templates
