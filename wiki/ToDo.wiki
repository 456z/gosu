#summary Gosu's ToDo list.
#labels Featured

=0.7.7 (due late October)=
  * implement frameskip
  * don't round updateInterval on Win/Linux
  * allow/document custom OpenGL integration
  * get rid of OpenGL tearing on OS X
  * get rid of OpenGL tearing on Windows
  * experiment with GC performance

= Also ASAP =
  * don't crash after shutdown when storing resources in @@'s (Ruby; Audio destruction sequence)
  * assure Gosu::File also creates directories as necessary
  * more sophisticated Audio interface for talking NPC's etc.
  * testing on Vista, Leopard, Panther

= Major design goals for 0.7.x (basics. input redesign - 2007) =
  * text input system for chat boxes, high-score lists etc.
  * rewrite Gosu::Input with support for multiple gamepads and analog joysticks, serializable button IDs, â€¦
  * make the Ruby wrapper's menu bar Command-Q work on OS X!
  * generate Rdoc
  * change wstring to string? (for 0.8.0)
  * force feedback would be a good fit for an input redesign. 2007 is packed even without this feature, though.

= Major design goals for 0.8.x (graphics) =
  * more alpha modes, yay!
  * find a way to factor rot flips out of Gosu => Image/draw redesign
  * implement clipping and a target() modifier for the new Image
  * multi-threaded blit queue?
  * make font substitution work on OS X, Windows
  * speed up LargeImageData!

= Major design goals for 0.9.x (IO, Strings) =
  * delegate Linux support, esp. wrt. gamepads (*help!!*)
  * the window argument in Ruby is annoying, because only one window can be used anyway. Maybe it should be Window.run, and all open Windows should work.
  * simplify Gosu's IO philosophy (C++)
  * document Gosu's Sockets

= Major design goals for 1.x (perfection) =
  * Windows: Input will regularly query devices which are not currently attached, thereby causing the game to halt every few seconds - think about this
  * FSAA/mipmap experiments
