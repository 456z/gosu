#summary Gosu's mixup between a roadmap and a short-term to-do list.
#labels Featured

= 0.7.9 (hopefully still '07) =
  * don't hide cursor unnecessarily (OS X)
  * real mouse wheel support (OS X)
  * port at least one Ruby example to C++ (OpenGL?)
  * bugfixes from issue tracker
  * TextInput minimal impl
  * milliseconds() very inexact on 10.5.2?

= ASAP =
  * Apple remote support would rule.
  * clean up after playing around with possible optimizations
  * get rid of OpenGL tearing on Windows (Intel GMA 950)
  * don't round updateInterval on Windows
  * don't round updateInterval on Linux
  * implement frameskip
  * more C++ examples
  * assure Gosu::File also creates directories as necessary
  * testing around with multiple monitors on Windows/OS X

= 0.8.0 (early 2008)=
  * clean up Gosu's C++ interface
  * rewrite Gosu::Input with support for multiple gamepads and analog joysticks, serializable button IDs, â€¦
  * allow FPS > 60 even with vsync

= Major design goals for 0.8.x (graphics, polish) =
  * make the Ruby wrapper's menu bar more complete on OS X
  * generate Rdoc
  * change wstring to string (with 0.8.0)
  * more alpha modes, yay!
  * find a way to factor rot flips out of Gosu => Image/draw redesign
  * implement clipping and a target() modifier for the new Image
  * more beautiful text! (kerning etc.?)
  * speed up LargeImageData!

= Major design goals for 0.9.x (IO) =
  * delegate Linux support, esp. wrt. gamepads (*help!!*)
  * the window argument in Ruby is annoying, because only one window can be used anyway. Maybe it should be Window.run, and all open Windows should work.
  * simplify Gosu's IO philosophy (C++)
  * document Gosu's Sockets

= Major design goals for 1.x (perfection) =
  * Windows: Input will regularly query devices which are not currently attached, thereby causing the game to halt every few seconds - think about this
  * FSAA/mipmap experiments
  * force feedback would be cool
