#summary Gosu's ToDo list.
#labels Featured

= Scheduled for 0.7.4 or 0.7.5, respectively =
  * use OpenGL on Windows
  * allow/document custom OpenGL integration

= Major design goals for 0.7x (immediately needed to complete playable games) =
  * text input system for chat boxes, high-score lists etc.
  * more sophisticated Audio interface for talking NPC's etc.
  * With UTF-8 support in C++ coming, get rid of all the wstring stuff. -> http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2209.html
  * delegate Linux support, esp. wrt. gamepads (*help!!*)
  * testing on Vista/OS X 10.3.9 would be cool.

= Major design goals for 0.8x (IO, timing) =
  * document Gosu's Sockets
  * the window argument in Ruby is annoying, because only one window can be used anyway. Maybe it should be Window.run, and all open Windows should work.
  * simplify Gosu's IO philosophy (C++)
  * redesign Gosu::Window to be more useful for framerate independent games?
  * anyway, get rid of WM_TIMER

= Major design goals for 0.9x (graphics) =
  * find a way to factor rot flips out of Gosu => Image/draw redesign
  * implement clipping and a target() modifier for the new Image
  * multi-threaded blit queue and float-z-ordering?

= Major design goals for 1.x (perfection) =
  * Windows: Input will regularly query devices which are not currently attached, thereby causing the game to halt every few seconds - think about this
  * FSAA dammit!!
