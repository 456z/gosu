=== Planets! ===

http://www.raschke.de/julian/temp/planets.jpg

This two-player shooter by Kurt Griffiths features very cool gravity and explosion effects, sound effects, support for optional music and sketch-themed graphics. Even though it has a [http://rubyforge.org/projects/planetsgame/ RubyForge project page], the available sources are outdated, so I updated them to the current Gosu API: [http://www.raschke.de/julian/temp/planets.zip Download source package].

=== Ruby OMF 2097 (Ruby) ===

Remake of the cool fighting game One Must Fall 2097 by Andrew Thompson, using Gosu. (Seemingly discontinued :( )

== Mini projects ==

Gosu has also been used a lot for participating in small game development competitions – with varying code quality, as you may have guessed. To run games from source code, make sure gosu.so/gosu.bundle is available, e.g. by copying it from your platform's Gosu release into the game's directory. Then run Main.rb from the command line via "ruby Main.rb", or from your favourite editor.

=== Nightly Travels of a Witch (Ruby) ===

http://www.raschke.de/julian/temp/NToaW.jpg

Written by Team Tortilla (Florian Groß, Alexander Post, Julian Raschke) for the 72h competition in the summer of 2006, this is a puzzle game with unusual controls, some nice touches like parallax scrolling and a particle engine. Of course, that time was saved by writing less code comments and levels. ;)

=== Encaved (Ruby) ===

Written by Florian Groß in 2004 as an entry to the Ludum Dare 48h competition. Compo theme was "Random", so it's about randomized dungeons in which you have to shoot guns and mines.
