#summary Shows how Gosu's main loop works.

= Gosu's Window Main Loop =

Usually, you create a subclass of Gosu::Window and override the parts that you need. Then, you create an instance of this class and call `show` on it. What happens then is this:

Examples of what you can do in these events are shown in the RubyTutorial and CppTutorial pages.

There are some variations to this loop: of course, you can allocate Images and other resources whenever you want. It might also be useful to call `show` twice. And the `close` function may not be called, technically, if the user closes the window using the standard methods on his operating system.
