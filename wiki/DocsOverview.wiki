= New to Gosu? =

If you are curious about what Gosu is trying to achieve, read Gosu's DesignRationale. If you want to take a look at random Gosu code, see the tutorials below.

= Installation =

Depending on your operating system, see GettingStartedOnOsx, GettingStartedOnWindows or GettingStartedOnLinux. (Before downloading the prebuilt Ruby versions, please note that they are also available via `gem install gosu`!)

= Tutorial =

See either the RubyTutorial or the CppTutorial.

There is also a French tutorial for Ruby/Gosu, which is slightly outdated on at least the Mac OS X part: http://xitog.developpez.com/tutoriels/gosu/?page=Presentation

= Reference =

C++: See the `reference/index.html` file that comes with all C++ archives.
Ruby: See the RubyReference.

= Ruby Game Packaging =

Since Ruby is not a compiled language, it is not obvious how to release games written in it to the public. For instructions see either RubyPackagingOnOsx or RubyPackagingOnWindows.

= Further inspiration =

There are some small, open source games you can take a look at on the GosuUsers page.
